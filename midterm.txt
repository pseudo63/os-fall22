===== Problem 1 =====
Open - opens the file specified by the first argument and returns an fd to be used to refer to that file. The second argument, flags, indicates access mode - in this case, read/write.

Read - reads data from file
(args)	
	o fd of file to be read from
	o buffer that read data will be written to
	o max bytes to read

Dup - duplicates an fd. In this case, fd2 refers to the same open file as fd1. They can be used interchangeably, so using one then two will still give sequential lines.

Question: Will calling open in process B keep the position in the file from process A?

===== Problem 4 =====
There are six options (named 1-6 for notes)
1 and 2 are mutually exclusive, and very likely one of them is correct. 1 is chosen.
3 is very strange and likely wrong
5 does not seem possible
